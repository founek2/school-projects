# MI-AFP homework #03

Homework to practice different ways of branching in Haskell and modularization

## Task

Open `src/Lib.hs` and implement all the TODOs there. You can also check the specification in `test/Spec.hs` and run the tests with `stack test`.

To complete you will need to work also with `src/Examples.hs` and `src/Data/DummyList/Examples.hs`, but you are **not allowed** to change those nor data types in `src/Lib.hs` and it is also forbidden to add new dependencies.

1. `czechSalutation` should return salutation (in nominative, 1st case = "1. pád") in the Czech language for given person (gender, age, marital status and academic titles must be used appropriately). For details read the comment in code and check test specification, you can also read [(1)](https://www.muni.cz/o-univerzite/uredni-deska/oslovovani-akademickych-pracovniku), [(2)](http://www.etiketavse.estranky.cz/clanky/etiketa/4.-oslovovani-a-spolecenska-vyznamnost.html), and [(3)](http://www.studenta.cz/vysokoskolske-tituly-jak-oslovovat-na-akademicke-pude/magazin/article/587) if interested (Czech only). *Do not edit prepared data types, just implement the function.*
2. `intervalContains` should tell for given number if is in interval or not. *Do not edit prepared data type, just implement the function.*
3. `shapeCircumference` and `shapeArea` should return circumference and area of given shape (can be Circle, Square, Rectangle, or Triangle). *Do not edit prepared data type, just implement the function.*
4. `geometricSequence` should return for given `a` (first parameter) and `r` (second parameter) a [geometric  sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression) as endless list.
5. `fibonacciNumbers` should return an endless list of [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). Try to find a solution on your own and enjoy laziness with Haskell - it is so easy...
6. `matrixMultiplication` returns a product of two matrices `x` and `y` ([matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication), check the size). You must use list comprehension!
7. `dummyListExample1`, `stringExample2`, `stringExample2` should be assigned with values from `Data.DummyList.Examples` (`example1`) and `Data.MyString.Examples` (`example2` and `example3`). It is **not allowed** to copy or "implement" them, working import must be used.

Hints & general requirements:

* Being [DRY](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is essential, do not repeat code (for example, in inversed comparison of intervals). However, do not forget [AHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself#AHA) principle as well.
* Local names (via `where` or `let-in`) in functions should be introduced to make the code more readable. Creating helper functions in module scope is **awful**.
* Avoid using `if-then-else` with patterns and guards (and/or combination of those two) if possible and better for readability.
* Look up functions that can help you (`Prelude`, `Data.List`) with general tasks like finding a maximum in list, converting `Integers` to generic numbers, or getting unique values from a list. *Do not re-invent the wheel!*
* You must understand your code completely!

## If you get stuck

* Draw the problem and try to split it
* Try to think in functions (what are inputs and output), try to decompose to simpler functions if it gets too complex
* Start with simple cases and build more complex (bottom-up)
* If you are really stuck, open issue or as in merge request
* Try to start with simpler tasks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7; esp. 2 and 3 will help you with grasping pattern-matching and branching needed in 1
* **Homeworks are designed to learn, do not hesitate to consult with teacher!**
