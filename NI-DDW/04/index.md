# HW4 - TBD!

I just want to say, I am bit confused about provided dataset and values of columns. Description of dataset does not contain any information about of values in columns mean - e.g. pageName=APPLICATION means for some weird reason user made reservation. Why this is not in description of dataset, but rather in task specification? What about other values? How am I supposed to think about some analyses, when there is nothing about meaning of values in columns in dataset description?

Solution is not pretty, I know and missing some features, but it just took too much of time.

## Issues

I stumbled upon many issues around Pandas and numpy. I did not use these libraries for some time and it is very hard to do transformations - I have spent hours just to get those matrixes from grouped data frames. With more experience I believe it would be super easy, but unfortunately I know what I want to do, but because of missing experience with these libraries I am unable to write code, which will do it in performant way
