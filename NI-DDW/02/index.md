# HW2 - TBD!

-   For text I wanted to chosen data retrieved in HW01, but since they are in Czech it would be problematic so I have downloaded content of these two articles written in english and put them into `src/text.txt`:
    -   https://www.teenvogue.com/story/breonna-taylor-family-friends-remember-her-greatness
    -   https://longreads.com/2020/03/16/tiger-trafficking-in-america/
-   Work can be found in evaluated notebook [./src/main.ipynb](./src/main.ipynb)

## Issues

-   Biggest issue was the weird behavior of Wikipedia package - more in notebook
-   I've spent a lot of time improving regex to detect noun phrase, but it is still not totally OK

## Improvements

-   Custom NER pattern could be improved, but I think that ne_chunk will still be better
