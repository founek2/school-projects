# Solution

## Main notebook

[./src/main.ipynb](./src/main.ipynb)

## Notebook with few visualization on smaller sample

[./src/community.ipynb](./src/community.ipynb)

## Exported graph

[./src/final.gexf](./src/final.gexf)

## Findings

Graph algorithms take some time on large graphs and require lot of CPU.

## Issues

I was kinda puzzled what exactly should be achieved in step "Compute graph embeddings and report results" - would be nice to have more description / better specification of what I should do.
